# Valentine's Day Website 💕

An interactive Valentine's Day proposal website with a fun twist - the "No" button runs away from your cursor!

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://valentines-day-website-eight.vercel.app](https://valentines-day-website-eight.vercel.app)

## Features

- Beautiful gradient background with floating hearts animation
- Interactive "No" button that escapes when you try to click it
- Celebration page with confetti effect when "Yes" is clicked
- Fully responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clean, modern UI with custom fonts

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and gradients)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Google Fonts (Pacifico & Poppins)
- Deployed on Vercel

## How It Works

The "No" button uses proximity detection to move away whenever the cursor gets close (within 150px). The button repositions randomly within the container, making it nearly impossible to click. The only way forward is clicking "Yes"!

## Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in your browser - no build process required!

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel for instant hosting and global CDN.
